<div class="introblock"><h7>Getting Started</h7><p class="borderblock"></p><p class="subheader_div">GRASSROOTS ACTION</p>
<p id="introtext">What propels a project from idea to implementation? Through Brown University's Teaching, Research, and Impact (TRI-Lab) Program, a team of three Brown and RISD students worked to make a real-world impact on stormwater management in Providence. This is their story, including obstacles and how they overcame them. </p>

<p id="introtext"> Recognizing the particular challenges of stormwater management in Providence, Kai Salem, Grace Molino, and Janice Gan sought a solution. In the spring of 2015, the three took part in Brown University’s TRI-Lab Program. The initiative develops collaborative projects that bring together students and faculty with community practitioners to engage with complex social issues and then develop, refine, and test solutions to these issues. Participants in the program work together to develop plans, research, and create positive social impact in Providence 
and Rhode Island as a whole.</p> 



<p id="introtext">Kai, Janice, and Grace participated in a session focusing on climate change, environmental justice, and resilience in Rhode Island. The team focused on the challenge of stormwater runoff. Project advisors Timmons Roberts and Julia Gold identified the West End neighborhood as a general area of focus. <br><br>Devoted to their project, all three also participated in an internship program at Clean Water Action over the summer, which was one of their community partners. In addition to Clean Water Action, the team also worked with Groundwork Providence, West Elmwood Housing Development Corporation, and West Broadway Neighborhood Association. </p></div>

<h2>The Problem</h2><p class="border"></p><p class="body-subheader">STORMWATER</p>
<img src="Images/storm.gif" width="60%" alt="" margin-left="50%" class="noborder">

<p class="text">Stormwater runoff carries trash, bacteria, and pollutants from the urban environment into nearby bodies of water. <br><br> Heavier rains and storm surges — which are predicted to occur more frequently due to global warming — can cause erosion and flooding, damaging habitats, property, and infrastructure.<br><br> In Rhode Island, stormwater runoff causes algal blooms that contaminate usable and drinking water supplies.</p>

 <div class="gap"></div>
 <div class="pipe"></div>

<h2>Current Solution</h2><p class="border"></p><p class="body-subheader">WHAT WE DO NOW</p>
<p class="text">In terms of stormwater management, traditional systems of pipes and water treatment facilities typically move water long distances for treatment.<br><br> When there’s more than an inch of rain, the city’s capacity for stormwater management is overwhelmed and raw sewage, along with untreated stormwater, overflows into rivers and Narragansett bay. As the frequency of intense storms increases due to climate change, this will become more and more problematic. </p>

 <div class="gap"></div>

 <h2>New Solution</h2><p class="border"></p><p class="body-subheader">GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE</p>

<img src="Images/GardenAnimation.gif" width="100%" class="greeninfrastructure">
<p class="text">Green infrastructure interventions reduce the stormwater going into the system by treating and absorbing it. Such projects takes advantage of natural elements and processes to manage water in urban environments, including Providence.<br><br>Examples of green infrastructure include planter boxes, rainwater harvesting systems, permeable pavements, and tree canopies. Rain gardens, such as the garden pictured in the illustration above, feature vegetation with deep root systems planted in a shallow depression to collect stormwater runoff from urban areas.</p>

<div class="gap"></div>

 <h2>Project Location</h2><p class="border"></p><p class="body-subheader">SELECTING A SITE</p>

<p class="text">Janice, Kai, and Grace were given a set of potential areas of focus through the Brown TRI-Lab program. All of the potential sites were local, limited to communities in Providence. The team selected the Dexter and Bucklin intersection as their green infrastructure project site. Below, the site can be seen from an aerial view with traffic patterns demarcated. </p>

<div class="map">

</div>

<p class="text">Through map data and anecdotal evidence, they identified the zone as a problematic intersection with significant traffic issues, no green space, and observed flooding. In addition, its proximity to residential areas, schools, and neighborhood gathering sites made it a worthwhile location for an intervention.</p>

<div class="gap"></div>


<h2>Methods</h2><p class="border"></p><p class="body-subheader">COLLECTING DATA</p>

<ul class="flex-container-methods">

<li class="flex-item-methods">
<img class="methods" src="Images/zones.png"><h3>Map Data</h3><p class="methodtext">The group analyzed GIS data including heat index, surface heat index, demographics, greatest need, surface pavement percentage, impervious surface cover, and tree cover to select a site.</p> <p class="quote" style="color:#FF4700">"We overlaid impervious surface cover with a Landsat snapshot of surface heat index. After overlaying that, we circled a few sites where there were underserved demographics, where there were a heat islands, and where there was a lot of impervious surface cover." — Janice</p>
</li>

<li class="flex-item-methods">
<img class="methods" src="Images/survey.png"><h3>Canvassing</h3><p class="methodtext">The team  collected anecdotal evidence by speaking directly with members of the community, including both businesses and households in the area.</p><p class="quote" style="color:#FF4700">"We really got to know the residents: we went to farmers’ markets and to the West Elmwood Housing Development. We tried to set up focus groups and just talk to as many people as we could. We walked the neighborhood almost every single day." — Kai </p></li>
  
  <li class="flex-item-methods"> 
  <img class="methods" src="Images/points.png"><h3>Synthesis</h3><p class="methodtext">Combining quantitative map data and qualitative data from community surveys and focus groups gave the team a sense of where they had the most community support and could make the most impact.</p><p class="quote" style="color:#FF4700">"We turned the qualitative data, observational data, as well as canvassing data into mapping points basically. So we used the map to observe patterns in the point data as well as the GIS heat maps." — Grace </p>

</ul>

<h2>Proposed Project</h2><p class="border"></p><p class="body-subheader">MAKING A RAIN GARDEN</p>

<p class="text">The team proposed a green infrastructure interventionin the form of a vegetated system to both capture and manage stormwater. Additional anticipated positive byproducts of the proposed solution include neighborhood beautification, traffic calming, and community development. Mouse over the overview below to view the current state of the site and the proposed intervention:
</p>

<p class="text">To visually communicate their concept to community partners and their Brown TRI-Lab program cohort, the team mocked up an anticipated version of what their green infrastructure intervention will look like. The new vegetated area can be previewed in the envisioned image of the future, visible on the right in the below images.

    <td><span style="font-weight:bold">Solution: Asking Experts</span><br><br>
Kai: Once we removed the concrete, we had no idea what we were going to find underneath it. So we contacted the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The department said that based on Providence’s past, we should assume that there will be high levels of heavy metals. But based on the square footage of our proposed site, which is about a thousand square feet, they didn’t think the infiltration would be large enough to mobilize the contaminants and bring them into the groundwater. So they gave us the go ahead on that. Which was great, because we had been planning on removing all the soil and disposing of it as hazardous waste and putting a cap at the bottom. 
Grace: We still had to dispose of the soil. 
Kai: But it was significantly less trouble than we thought.</td>

Kai: "We wanted to pick vegetation that would be hardy enough to survive the winters here, as well as survive being run over by cars, the salted roads. And then if we had to cap the soil then we couldn’t put in trees because of the root systems." 
Janice: "The trees couldn’t have branches that would fall into the roads..." <br><br>

Kai: "But there’s no GIS data." <br><br>

Regular watering and weeding is generally required, and even after that there’s periodic making sure traps aren’t filling up." <br><br>

<p id="introtext">Although the project is on hold due to new obstacles in terms of finalizing permits, the team remains optimistic. The TRI-Lab experience proved to be a lesson in community engagement, environmental intervention, and working with stakeholders. The team emerged from the project with a key insight:<br><br><img src="Images/community-01.png" class="endimage">
<span style=" font-size: 25px">"One of the reasons I think our project was pretty successful…was because <span style="color:#FF4700">we had this direction from the community organizations from the beginning</span>, and that was a stated need that made us feel a little bit more like there was a reason for us doing it and also sustained the project. That’s a key part of community-based participatory research, which is one of the things we studied…is that <span style="color:#FF4700">projects and especially projects from students need to come from a stated need </span>of the community."<br><br></span><span style=" font-size: 25px; font-style: italic">- Grace Molino</span></p>
